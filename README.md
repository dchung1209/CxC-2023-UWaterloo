# CxC-2023-UWaterloo


This project is an example of how to classify medical text data into categories using scikit-learn machine learning library. The aim of this project is to showcase how to use scikit-learn to preprocess, clean, visualize and classify medical text data.

## Dataset
For this project, we will use the medical text data provided by Intact for the CxC hackathon. The dataset consists of medical text descriptions from various medical specialties, including cardiology, neurology, and radiology.

ID: The unique identifier for each record.
Description: The text description of the medical transcription.
Category: The category associated with the transcription.
The dataset can be accessed through the CxC hackathon platform.

## Preprocessing and Cleaning
Before we can start the classification process, we need to preprocess and clean the text data. This includes tasks such as tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming. We can use the nltk library to perform these tasks.

## Visualization
To gain a better understanding of the data, we can use visualization techniques such as word clouds and bar charts.

## Classification
Once we have preprocessed and visualized the data, we can start the classification process. We can use various machine learning algorithms provided by scikit-learn, such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests, to classify the medical text data into categories.

## Conclusion
This project provides an overview of how to classify medical text data into categories using scikit-learn machine learning library. The techniques used in this project can be applied to other text classification tasks as well.
